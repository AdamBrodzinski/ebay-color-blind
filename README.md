Ebay for the Color Blind
================

A very small Chrome extension to help red/green color blind people browse ebay.

While browsing for the latest iPhone resale value, I became very frustrated when I could not quickly pick apart which completed items were sold and which ones did not sell. The default is a red and green which is very hard (for me) to distinguish. I changed these color values to a lime green and a dark red.
*Please let me know if there are better colors to use for other color blind people!*

Now available for the Stylish plugin/extension <br>
